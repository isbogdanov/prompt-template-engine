instructions: |
  You operate in a loop of Thought, Tool, PAUSE, Observation.
  1. Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
  2. Use Tool to call one of the ##tools## available to you.
  3. After outputting the Tool call, you MUST output `PAUSE` on a new line and then STOP your generation immediately. DO NOT generate anything else. You MUST wait for the Observation.
  4. Observation will be the result of calling your tool execution. It will be provided by the system after you output PAUSE and stop.
  5. At the end of the loop you output an Answer only in specific format.
