# This is a blueprint for a ReAct agent. To create your own agent, copy this
# file to your project's definitions folder, and fill in the content.

# 1. Declare the agent type. The engine uses this to apply the correct logic.
agent_type: react

# 2. Define the core persona of your agent.
system_message: "You are a helpful assistant."

# 3. List the critical, high-level rules the agent must follow.
rules:
  - "You must use the provided tools when necessary."
  - "Your final answer must be clear and concise."

# 4. Define the tools available to the agent.
tools:
  - name: "search"
    description: "Searches for information on the web."
    example_calling: "search: latest news on AI"

# 5. Provide examples of how the agent should behave.
examples:
  - name: "Successful Search"
    steps:
      - type: "thought"
        content: "I need to find the capital of France. I should use the search tool."
      - type: "tool_call"
        name: "search"
        input: "capital of France"
      - type: "observation"
