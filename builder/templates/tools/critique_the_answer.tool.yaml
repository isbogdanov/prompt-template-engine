- name: "critique_the_answer"
  description: "Provide a critical assessment of your own proposed thought or final answer. Identify potential flaws, missed assumptions, or alternative interpretations. This tool MUST only be called immediately after 'raise_a_question'."

  example_calling: "critique_the_answer: My current plan is to proceed with Action A, but have I considered the potential unintended consequences?"

  examples:
    - name: "Refining a Plan with Self-Critique"
      description: "An example of using `raise_a_question` followed by `critique_the_answer` to identify flaws in an initial plan."
      steps:
        - type: "custom"
          content: "Situation: I am presented with a complex situation with multiple interacting factors."
        - type: "thought"
          content: "The situation seems to point towards a primary cause. My initial plan is to address that cause directly."
        - type: "tool_call"
          name: "raise_a_question"
          input: "Is addressing this primary cause the best first step, or could there be an underlying factor I'm missing?"
        - type: "observation"
          content: "You have chosen to ask yourself: Is addressing this primary cause the best first step, or could there be an underlying factor I'm missing? What can you answer yourself?"
        - type: "thought"
          content: "That's a good question. Let me critique my own plan before acting."
        - type: "tool_call"
          name: "critique_the_answer"
          input: "Critique: Focusing only on the primary cause is a narrow approach. It doesn't account for other contributing factors and might lead to a recurring problem. I should analyze the situation more broadly first."
        - type: "observation"
          content: "You have provided a critique. What is your next thought?"
        - type: "thought"
          content: "The critique is valid. I need a better, more comprehensive plan. I will first analyze all contributing factors before deciding on a course of action. This is a more robust approach."
        - type: "answer"
          content: "My plan is to first conduct a comprehensive analysis of all factors involved before taking any corrective action."

    - name: "Confident Execution without Critique"
      description: "An example of proceeding with a plan confidently when no self-critique is necessary."
      steps:
        - type: "custom"
          content: "Situation: The problem I'm facing has a clear and unambiguous cause."
        - type: "thought"
          content: "The problem is straightforward and the solution is obvious. I am confident in my diagnosis and the required action."
        - type: "answer"
          content: "I will proceed with the clear and direct solution."
